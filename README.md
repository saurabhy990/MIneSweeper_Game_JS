## JavaScript Fundamentals
The Minesweeper game implementation in JavaScript covers various fundamental concepts:

DOM Manipulation: Interacting with HTML elements to dynamically create the game board and update the UI.

Event Handling: Managing user interactions with the game grid, such as left-clicks to reveal cells and right-clicks to flag potential mines.

## Asynchronous Programming: Using setTimeout to delay the revealing of neighboring cells when an empty cell is clicked.

## Conditional Statements and Loops: Employing loops to iterate over the game grid and conditional statements for decision-making logic.

## Functions: Defining functions to encapsulate specific functionalities, such as handling clicks, checking for a win, and managing the game over state.
